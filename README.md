+ Looking at the bar chart, we can see that the Mercedes E 200 manufactured in 2021 is the most expensive of 4 types of luxury automobiles, at 3,700,000. This is nearly double the price of the Volvo XC60 (2018) and BMW 320 (2017). It is also more than three times the price of the Audi A3 (2015), which has the lowest price.

+ In general, the luxury brands have a considerable price gap even among used cars. Moreover, the age of the automobiles plays a crucial role in that the newer releases tend to be priced higher. Especially, Mercedes also remained a premium price, reflecting its status in the luxury segment.

+ The bar chart shows the resale price of used KIA Cerato automobiles based on color manufactured in 2010. Among three colors, including black, silver, and red, silver commands the highest resale price at 650,000, followed by black at 620,000, and red at the lowest with 600,000. This suggests that color plays a role in buyer preference and market value, even when other variables such as model year and type of car are constant.
  
+ The highest price for silver cars may reflect a broader market preference for neutral and less flashy colors, which tend to have greater resale appeal. Overall, when pricing used vehicles, color is a subtle but important factor that can influence buyer perception and market demand.
